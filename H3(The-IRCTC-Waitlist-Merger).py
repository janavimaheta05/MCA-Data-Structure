h3) Merge Sort — The IRCTC Waitlist Merger

IRCTC has two separately sorted waitlists — one from its mobile app,
 one from railway counters. To produce a final unified waitlist, 
 they don’t re-sort from scratch. They merge both sorted lists in one pass — compare 
 the front of each list, pick the smaller token, advance. This is exactly merge sort’s merge step.
