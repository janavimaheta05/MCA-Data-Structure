"""
C2) The Scholarship Ranker
A college must give scholarships to the top 3 scorers. 
The coordinator scans the entire marksheet, finds the highest scorer, moves them to position 1. 
Then scans the remaining students for the next highest, and so on. 
Each pass = one full scan to select the minimum/maximum.
